# InterpreterProgram
Program to interpret simple programming language

This program was written for a lab for a principles of programming languages class. It's an interpreter that was designed to read in a simple program. coreprogram.txt and coreprogram2.txt are two examples of the language. The first program can be run as 'python MainProgram.py coreprogram.txt input.txt' and the other as 'python MainProgram.py coreprogram2.txt'. The interpreter reads the input program, prints it to the terminal and then performs the steps of the program. The input.txt file is for variables that later get initialized in the program, such as when 'read X4' is seen. Input vales are on one line separated by a tab for each consecutive read seen by the program.
